Design Document for program RPS.py


General Description: This program holds functions for a game that 
		automatically plays rock,paper,scissors 
		with two computer players.

How to run: Run RPS.py and issue rps(numberOfgames), where numberOfGames is a 
	positive int representing the total number of games played.

Inputs: Number of games (int)

Outputs: Returns string showing total ties, wins of player one,
         and wins of player 2

Main Algorithm: 
	We take in the number of games played and check that
	the input is a number and is positive.  Next, we loop for the number
	of games to be played and for each game do the following:
	* get player1 and player2 weapons
	* check if the players tie, win, or loose
	* increment counters for total ties, player1 wins, or player 2 wins

	At the end of the program we ouptut the number of ties, player1 wins,
	and player2 wins
