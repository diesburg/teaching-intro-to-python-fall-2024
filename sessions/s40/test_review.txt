Please tell me the data type of the for loop iterator based on the context.

thing = "As you lead us onto fame and honor, FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT! Will be our cry."

1. 
for element in thing:

What is element?

2. 
thing = thing.split()

for element in thing:

What is element?

3. 
thing = thing.split()
for element in thing:
	for something in element:

What is something?

---------------------




4. 
sentence = "as you lead us onto fame and honor FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT will be our cry"

Write a function called countWords(sentence) that takes in a string and prints each word followed by a count.  Don't worry about "cleaning" the sentence -- e.g. lowercasing and removing punctuation.




5. 
listOfGrades = [70.5, 81.2, 77.4, 90, 85]

Write a function called findAverage(a_list) that takes in a list of numbers and returns the average.





6. 
Bob = {'France','Germany','Canada'}
Alice = {'Canada','Jamaica','Brazil'}

Write a function called placesInCommon(set1, set2) that takes in two sets and returns a list of the places in common that they have visited?




7. Create a function called lineNumbers() that takes no parameters.  It should
open a file called 'test.txt', read each line, and produce an output file
with line numbers at the beginning of each line.  Let's name the output file
output.txt.
