<li>When going through these <a href="mysteryFunctions.py">mystery functions</a>, ask yourself two questions:
	<ol>
    	<li>What <i>types</i> of arguments can they take?</li>
        <li>What does the function actually do?</li>
    </ol>
 </li>
	</ul>

<li> This final Blackboard exam is cumulative but will focus on materials covered since the midterm.  It will be located in the class BlackBoard page under the exams link.</li>
<li> This test is open-book and pen-notes test (just like the midterm).  However, it is timed to 50 minutes.  If you do not study, you will not have time to look up many answers or finish the test. If you take longer than 50 minutes without a reason or accommodataion, I will deduct a lot of points.</li>
<li> <b><i>The test must be taken during your final exam schedule block for this course unless you have an accommodation</i></b>. </li>
<li> If you need to reschedule this test for any reason, it is your responsibility to contact me before the exam. If you do not, you may not get a chance to take it.</li>
<li> Good luck on your final!</li>
