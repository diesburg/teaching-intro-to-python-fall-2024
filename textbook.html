<p>You can also buy your sign-up code from the local bookstore for the same price.  (This is handy if you need to pay using financial aid.)  You still need to log into <a href="http://learn.zybooks.com">learn.zybooks.com</a> to redeem your code and gain access to the textbook.</p>
	<p><b>You will be graded on doing assigned participation activities, starting on the first week of class!</b> If your financial aid has not yet come through to purchase the book, zyBooks will work with you to provide you access to the textbook until you can set up payment!  Please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@zybooks.com">support@zybooks.com</a> to explain your situation and request a deferment. </p>
