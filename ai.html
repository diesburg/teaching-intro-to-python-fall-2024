	<h3>Summary</h3>
	
	<ol>
<li>Do not use AI tools to generate programs for this class. (See the Full AI Statement below for the explanation.)</li>
<li>Using AI tools to create homework or lab solutions will put you at risk of a code review meeting with me and risk not understanding coding enough to pass the exams.  Failing the exams will cause you to fail the class.</li>
<li>If I see advanced homework or lab solutions using coding that was not introduced in class, I will send you an email to meet with me within a week.<ul>
	<li>If you have advanced programming knowledge and are able to explain the code you submitted, that's great!  I'll learn a bit more about your previous experience and put you on a list not to bug again.</li>
	<li>If you cannot explain your code or do not meet with me within a week, the homework or lab assignment will turn into a grade of 0.</li></ul></li>

<h3>Full AI Statement</h3>
<p><i>--Written by Sarah Diesburg</i></p>
	
<p>AI is rapidly changing the face of software engineering.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are rapidly developing that can generate full programs based on a prompt (e.g. chatGPT and Bard) to being a "copilot" and suggesting lines of code as you are writing. These tools hold great promise to increase our productivity as programmers.</p>
	
<p>As software developers, we are tasked with the incredibly important job of making sure code we use or produce is correct, free from errors, and does not introduce security issues.  To properly use these AI tools in the future as professionals, <b><i>we first need to understand how code works</i></b>, inside and out.  Only once we understand how to code can we read, test, and properly evaluate code generated by AI tools.  Therefore, <b><i>the purpose of this class is to teach you how to fully understand the foundations of coding by creating introductory-level programs to solve problems without the use of AI</i></b>.
	</p>
	
<p>In an "intro to programming" class, it will probably be very tempting to ask an AI to write your homework solutions for you.  However, doing this cheats you of the chance to go through the struggle that truly comes with learning to program.  More than 50% of the class will be evaluated on your abilities to read and write code in exam environments without access to an AI.  <b><i>If you can't generate and read code yourself without the use of an AI, you will fail exams and the class.</i></b> You really have to know your stuff. </p>
	
<p>On the topic of knowing your stuff...</p>
	
<p>If I notice code in homework or lab submissions that uses coding concepts that we haven't covered in class, this may be because some of you have prior programming knowledge or experience.  That's great!  However, AI tools will also create such code.  To make sure that the code was written by you and not an AI, I will put a marker in the gradebook and ask you to make a short 15 minute meeting with me within a week to explain your code and use any advanced concepts I see in your code to solve a different problem of my choosing.  If you know your stuff, I'll put you on a list not to bug you again and give you a few extra credit points as a reward.  However, if you fail to demonstrate you understand the code you turned in or else do not meet with me within a week, I'll replace the marker in the gradebook with a grade of 0 for the homework or lab.</p>
	
	<p>In summary, the purpose of AI tools is not to replace programmers.  Instead, they are meant to speed up the productivity of programmers once they can read the code produced to verify it is correct, free from errors, and does not introduce security issues.  This class is to help you with that first step of knowing how code works.  At this level, this means knowing how to create code by yourself.</p>
