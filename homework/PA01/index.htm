<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Your book spends a lot of time talking about problem solving.&nbsp; Let's 
look at how this would work, at least for some small problems.</p>

<p>Notes and requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that your program output looks <b>exactly</b> like the sample program output on this page. <b><i>The autograder may have trouble giving you all the points if your output is formatted differently.  Check your output spelling and spacing.</b></i><br><br>  </li>
  <li>Make sure that you are putting your name and the program header at the top of your programs. Look at the 
	  <a href="../policies_and_forms/collection_policy.htm">Program Header Policy</a> for more information.<br><br></li> 
  <li>Use meaningful variable names.  The variable name <b>original_speed</b> is good, because I can tell what it represents.  The variable name <b>total2</b> is less good, because it is less descriptive.<br><br> </li>
  <li>Your programs should ask for input in the exact order specified in the exercises below.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Program 1.1 </strong>(out of 4 points)</h3>
	<p>Create a program named <b>distance.py</b></p>
  <p>Miles Prower is an over-the-road truck driver. He is interested in figuring out how long it will take him to get to the next exit.</p>
    <p>Write a Python script that conforms to the following</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inputs
            <ul>
              <li>Asks for the current speed</li>
              <li>Asks for the distance  to travel</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Print Statements
            <ul>
              <li>Prints how long it will take (in minutes) to get there.</li>
              <li>You should round the time to 1 decimal place</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Example(s)
            <ul>
              <li><img src="materials/3.png" alt="screenshot"></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Special Instructions
            <ul>
              <li>Remember that MPH tells us how many miles he will travel in 60 minutes</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Program 1.2</strong> (out of 6 points)</h3>
  Create a program named <b>parkingGarage.py</b>
<p>Laurie Park makes payment machines for municipal parking garages. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Her  machines charge for parking in increments of 25 cents.</li>
  <li>Her machines accept payment in quarters and $1, $5, and $10 bills. </li>
  <li>Her machines can only give change in $1 (dollar bills) and $0.25 (quarters)</li>
</ul>
    <p>Write a Python script that conforms to the following</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inputs
            <ul>
              <li>Asks for the charge for parking (remember, it will be in increments of quarters)</li>
              <li>Asks for the amount of money received from the customer</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Print Statements
            <ul>
              <li>Prints the number of dollar bills and the number of quarters needed to make change.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Example(s)
            <ul>
              <li><img src="materials/12.png" alt="screenshot"></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Special Instructions
            <ul>
              <li>Both values calculated are integers and should be treated/displayed as such.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
    </ul>
  <hr>

  
  <h3><strong>Program 1.3</strong> (out of 10 points)</h3>
Create a program called <b>fuelSavings.py</b>
		<ul>
			<li>I want to know how much I would save on fuel if I bought something more fuel efficient, e.g., a hybrid car.  I think the numbers I need are miles driven per year, MPG in my current car, MPG of the new car, and the cost of gasoline.  Report the fuel cost for each car and the savings (or loss--a negative number) with the new/hybrid car.</li>
			<li>Here is an example:<br><img src="m2d1-docs/7.PNG"></li>
			<li>Special Instructions
            <ul>
              <li>The current cost of gas per gallon should be treated as a float, but the other inputs can be treated as integers.</li>
			<li>The output should be printed as a float.  It is ok if has less or more than two places after the decimal.</li>
            </ul>
	    </ul>&nbsp;
   
<hr><h3><strong>Final Submission</strong></h3>
	<p>Please submit all three programs to the Program Submission System by the due date and time.</p>
