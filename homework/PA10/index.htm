<h3>Assignment Overview</h3>

<p>You have been given a <a href="secret.txt">secret message</a>, but <em><strong>how do you decrypt and read it</strong></em>???</p>
		
<p>Unlike regular encryption, this file has every plain letter/character you need to make sense of the study guide.  Unfortunately, there are also random characters in between each good character.  You will have to write code that will: <ul>
		<li>Read a good character from the encoded file</li>
		<li>Write that good character to an output file</li>
		<li>Figure out how many bad characters to skip over until you get to the next good character</li>
		<li>Skip over those bad characters</li>
		<li>Start the process over again until you reach the end of the file</li></ul>

We can always assume that the first character of the file is a good character.</p>
	
	<p>How do we figure out how many characters to skip?</p>
	
	<pre>
After uppercase letters - skip ahead by its ascii value - 61 positions
After lowercase letters - skip ahead by its ascii value - 91 positions
After numbers - skip ahead by its int() number value + 1 positions
After anything else - +1 if acsii value is even, +0 (just read the next character) if ascii value is odd
	</pre>
	
	<p>We also know that the following file <a href="helloworld.txt">helloworld.txt</a> will decode to:<br><br>
  Hello world 123!!!</p>

<p>In a file called pa10.py write a method called decode(inputfile,outputfile).&nbsp; 
  Decode should take two parameters - both of which are strings.&nbsp; The first 
  should be the name of an encoded file (either helloworld.txt or 
  mystery.txt or yet another file that I might use to test 
  your code).&nbsp; The second should be the name of a file that you will use as 
  an output file.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decode(&quot;secret.txt&quot; , &quot;translatedguide.txt&quot;)</p>
<p>Your method should read in the contents of the inputfile and, using the 
  scheme described in the hints.txt file above, decode the hidden message, writing to the outputfile as 
it goes (or all at once when it is done depending on what you decide to use).</p>
<p>Hint: Be sure to get the helloworld.txt file to decode before working on the large studyguide.</p>
<p>Hint: Don't forget about while loops...</p>
<p><b>Mac hint: use encoding="utf-8" in your file open functions, like this:
	<pre>fin = open(input_file,"r",encoding="utf-8")</pre></b></p>

  <p align="left"><strong>Submitting your assignment</strong></p>
<p>To upload your homework for grading, submit your program to the homework submission system.  It will give partial credit.  <br>Hint: First get capital letters working, then lowercase letters, then numbers, then everything else...</p>
 
	<p>Congrats on submitting the last assignment of the semester!</p>
