<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>This week we have been working with for and while loops.&nbsp; Let's see if 
you understand this idea.</p>
<p>Notes and requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you save your programs in the correctly named files</li>
  <li>Make sure that you are following the
  <a href="../policies_and_forms/collection_policy.htm">proper policies 
  regarding code based homework</a></li>
  <li>Use meaningful variable names</li>
  <li>Use meaningful constants and names where appropriate and use proper style </li>
  <li>Your programs should ask for input in the exact order specified in the program specifications below.</li>
</ul>

 <h3><strong>Program 3.1 (4 points)</strong></h3>
			<p>Create a program named <b>money.py</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Let's create a program to demonstrate the effects of compound interest. A bank account, for example, may have its interest compounded every year: in this case, an account with $1000 initial principal and 20% interest per year would have a 
				 balance of $1200 at the end of the first year, $1440 at the end of the second year, and so on.</li>
				<li>Write a program that:<ul>
					<li>prompts the user for an amount of money to invest in the compounding account</li>
  					<li>prompts the user for the interest rate per year</li>
  					<li>prompts the user the number of years to compound</li>
  					<li>uses a <b>for loop</b> to display the balance of the account for each year</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>For example:<br> <img border="0" src="index.1.gif" ></li>
		  </ul>

	<h3><b>Program 3.2 (6 points)</b></h3>
	<p>Create a program named <b>buffet.py</b></p>
    <p>A particular buffet in town determines the price of your meal based on the age of the guests.
    </p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Guests 2 and younger are free</li>
      <li>Children between 3 and 12 are $4.50</li>
      <li>Seniors 65 and over cost $9.50</li>
      <li>All other customers cost $11.00</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Write a Python program containing a while loop that will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask for the age of the customer over and over again until the cashier inputs -1</li>
      
      <li>Calculates the cost of each customer</li>
	  <li>Adds the cost of each customer to the total bill</li>
	  <li>Prints the total bill after the cashier has entered -1 to quit</li>
      
      <li>Example:<br>		<img src="materials/w12.png"></li>
      </ul>

	<h3><b>Program 3.3 (10 points)</b></h3>
	<p><strong>Write a program called gcd.py</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ms. Aljehbrah is a math teacher.  </li>
      <li>She is having a problem teaching her students about the Greatest Common Divisor.</li>
      <li>If you recall, the GCD is the <strong>largest</strong> integer that is a divisor for two (or more) integers.</li>
      <li>For example,
        <ul>
          <li>the GCD of 24 and 54 is 6 since no number larger than 6 divides evenly into both 24 and 54.</li>
          <li>the GCD of 24 and 8 is 8 since 8 divides 24 on its own.</li>
          <li>the GCD of 9 and 8 is 1 since neither number has any factor in common.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In Middle/High School math we often teach students a variety of algorithms that determine the GCD of two number.
        <ul>
          <li>One algorithm for calculating GCD is the following:
            <pre>get two integers labled m and n
set d to be the smaller of m and n  
while m is not divisble by d OR n is not divisible by d
    subtract one from d  
report d as the greatest common divisor</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Write a Python function that conforms  to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask for a first and second integer</li>
      <li>Calculate and print the greatest common denominator using a while loop.</li>
	  <li>Example runs:<br><br>
      <img src="materials/w08.png" height=""></li>
      </ul>
