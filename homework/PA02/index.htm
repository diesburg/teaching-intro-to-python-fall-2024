<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>This week we have been working with selection statements.&nbsp; Let's see if 
you understand this idea.</p>
<p>Notes and requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you save your programs in the correctly named files</li>
  <li>Make sure that you are following the
  <a href="../policies_and_forms/collection_policy.htm">proper policies 
  regarding code based homework</a></li>
  <li>Use meaningful variable names</li>
  <li>Your programs should ask for input in the exact order specified in the customer requests below.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
 <h3><strong>Program 2.1 (5 points)</strong></h3>
			<p>Create a program named <b>tip.py</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>I always tip 20% of the meal cost. But I know that people working at inexpensive places work as hard to serve me as those in expensive places so I always tip at least $2.50. Produce code that will calculate my tip. </li>
				<li>Accept an input value as a float for the meal cost, and calculate and print the tip.</li>
				<li>Here is an example:<br><img src="tip01.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="tip02.PNG"></li>
		  </ul>
			&nbsp;



<hr>
  <h3><strong>Program 2.2 (8 points)</strong></h3>
  Create a program named <b>weather.py</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Produce code to accept a number indicating the percentage of the sky that has clouds and report a cloudiness descriptor, according to the following chart. </li><br>
			<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td><b>Percentage</b></td>
				<td><b>Description</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>30 or less</td>
				<td>Clear</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>between 31 and 70</td>
					<td>Partly cloudy</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>between 71 and 99</td>
					<td>Cloudy</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>exactly 100</td>
					<td>Overcast</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

		  <h3><strong>Program 2.3 (12 points)</strong></h3>
  Create a program named <b>shipping.py</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Write a Python program that calculates the shipping cost based on the weight of the package and the shipping method. Use nested if statements to determine the final shipping cost.  The program should ask for two inputs: a shipping method and weight (in that order).  Determine the shipping cost based on the following criteria.</li>
				<li>For "standard" shipping:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If the weight is up to 1 kg, the cost is $5.</li>
					<li>If the weight is more than 1 kg and up to 5 kg, the cost is $10.</li>
					<li>If the weight is above 5 kg, the cost is $20.</li>				
				</ul>
				<li>For "express" shipping:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If the weight is up to 1 kg, the cost is $10.</li>
					<li>If the weight is more than 1 kg and up to 5 kg, the cost is $20.</li>
					<li>If the weight is above 5 kg, the cost is $40.</li>				
				</ul>
				<li>For "overnight" shipping:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If the weight is up to 1 kg, the cost is $25.</li>
					<li>If the weight is more than 1 kg and up to 5 kg, the cost is $35.</li>
					<li>If the weight is above 5 kg, the cost is $60.</li>				
				</ul>
				<li>Finally, print the cost or else the message 'That choice was not valid.'</li>
				<li>Use lowercase letters "s" for standard, "e" for express, and "o" for overnight.</li>
				<li>Here is an example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/3-1.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/3-2.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/3-3.PNG"></li>
				
			</ul>
