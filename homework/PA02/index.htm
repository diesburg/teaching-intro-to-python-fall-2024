<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>This week we have been working with selection statements.&nbsp; Let's see if 
you understand this idea.</p>
<p>Notes and requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you save your programs in the correctly named files</li>
  <li>Make sure that you are following the
  <a href="../policies_and_forms/collection_policy.htm">proper policies 
  regarding code based homework</a></li>
  <li>Use meaningful variable names</li>
  <li>Your programs should ask for input in the exact order specified in the customer requests below.</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>
 <h3><strong>Program 2.1 (5 points)</strong></h3>
			<p>Create a program named <b>tip.py</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>I always tip 20% of the meal cost. But I know that people working at inexpensive places work as hard to serve me as those in expensive places so I always tip at least $2.50. Produce code that will calculate my tip. </li>
				<li>Accept an input value as a float for the meal cost, and calculate and print the tip.</li>
				<li>Here is an example:<br><img src="tip01.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="tip02.PNG"></li>
		  </ul>
			&nbsp;



<hr>
  <h3><strong>Program 2.2 (8 points)</strong></h3>
  Create a program named <b>weather.py</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Produce code to accept a number indicating the percentage of the sky that has clouds and report a cloudiness descriptor, according to the following chart. </li><br>
			<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td><b>Percentage</b></td>
				<td><b>Description</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>30 or less</td>
				<td>Clear</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>between 31 and 70</td>
					<td>Partly cloudy</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>between 71 and 99</td>
					<td>Cloudy</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>exactly 100</td>
					<td>Overcast</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<li>Here is an example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/4-1.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/4-2.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/4-3.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/4-4.PNG"></li>
				
				
				
				
			</ul>

		  <h3><strong>Program 2.3 (12 points)</strong></h3>
  Create a program named <b>height.py</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal height for US females is 64 inches plus/minus 2.5 inches and for US males it is 69.5 inches plus/minus 3 inches.  Accept input values indicating gender (F or M) and height and then report whether a person with those characteristics is within the average height range.</li>
				<li>Hint: Is 66.5 inches in the average range or not for a female person? (It is in this case, but 66.6 is not.)  Be sure you test all of these "boundary cases".</li>
				
				<li>Here is an example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/3-1.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/3-2.PNG"></li>
				<li>Here is another example:<br><img src="m2d3-docs/3-3.PNG"></li>
				
			</ul>
