Design Document for program numberCounter.py

General Description: This program determines the number of digits D inside a larger number N.

Inputs: A large number N and a small digit D.  The number N
is checked to be sure it is a number and positive.  The digit
D is checked to be a number between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Algorithm: 
	* Set a counter to zero.
	* For each digit D in the number N:
		* Look at the last digit in N (using %)
		* Increment the counter every time we see a digit
		  that equals our target value
		* Shrink N by one digit (using //)
		* Repeat until there are no more digits to look at 
		  in N.

Outputs: Prints number of digit D that can be found in number N.
