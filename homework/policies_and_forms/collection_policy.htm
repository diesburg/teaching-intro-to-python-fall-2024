<h4>Introduction </h4>
<p>This document outlines the rules you should follow when submitting an  
assignment or lab in CS 1510 Introduction to Computer Science.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These rules will simplify the grader's job by standardizing the form and 
appearance of submissions. Any of these rules can be overridden by a particular 
assignment but if the assignment doesn't say otherwise, follow each of them. </p>
<hr>
<h4>Header Block</h4>
<p>Every piece of python code that you submit, 
in either lab or as a programming assignment, should contain a header block 
containing three pieces of information as shown below:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="collec2.gif" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the sphere.py code from Lab02 had been a homework I would 
have submitted:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="collec1.gif" ></p>
	<p>You may lose style points if your program does not have a header like this, or if the header is not properly filled in for the specific lab or assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h4>Forms of Submission</h4>
<p>Some weeks you will be writing code from scratch.&nbsp; 
  Other weeks you will be modifying code that we give you.&nbsp; Some weeks it 
  may even be both.&nbsp; In either case, you will be prompted to submit some 
  fairly specific number of  files.&nbsp; The format of these files may change 
  over the semester.&nbsp; Please pay close attention to the instructions for 
  each lab or assignment regarding the type of files required and the naming conventions.</p>
<p>You will submit these files through the <a href="http://hypnos.cs.uni.edu">program submission system</a>. &nbsp;You may continue to submit assignment solutions up to 2 days late, but each day late incurs a 10% penalty. Labs are due on the day they are assigned and may be graded by either completion, effort, or both.</p>
